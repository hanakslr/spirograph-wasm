# spirograph-wasm

![Spirograph](spirograph.jpg)

Math is cool. Art is cool. Spirograph = math + art.

I built this to explore Rust + WASM - to learn more or test it out live visit my [blog post](https://hanakslr.com/posts/rust-wasm).

To build `wasm-pack build --target web` to serve: `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
